# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This is where I push my code as I work through various LeetCode problems. Feel free to browse through the solutions and understand the logic behind them. Don't hesitate to contribute or suggest better ways to solve the problems!

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `./`: This directory contains all the source code files for the solutions.
- `linkedlist/`: This directory contains an implementation of LinkedList as a pyhton library.

## Problem List

Here, I'll list all the problems that I've solved:

- `1290.py`: [LeetCode Problem 1290 - Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)
- `1721.py`: [LeetCode Problem 1721 - Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/)
- `19.py`: [LeetCode Problem 19 - Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
- `19_not_19_but_reverse.py`: Alternate approach to 19.
- `203.py`: [LeetCode Problem 203 - Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)
- `206.py`: [LeetCode Problem 206 - Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
- `2095.py`: [LeetCode Problem 2095 - Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/)
- `876.py`: [LeetCode Problem 876 - Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
- `92.py`: [LeetCode Problem 92 - Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
- `237.py`: [Leetcode Problem 237 - Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/)

I have also implemented a Linked List library. To install the Library follow the steps:<br>
1. Navigate to the linkedlist: <br>
`cd linkedlist`
2. Initiate a python virtual environment: <br>
`python3 -m venv env`
3. Activate the virtual environment: <br>
`source env/bin/activate`
4. Install the library using `pip`: <br>
`pip install .`
5. Run the test to validate installation: <br>
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
